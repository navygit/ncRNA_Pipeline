# EnsEMBL module for Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::Config::Blast;

=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::Config::Blast

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::Config::Blast;
    use Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::Config::Blast qw();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration for blast-type analyses. Primarily this is used to
specify a regex for each database that is used to extract the
correct accession.

It imports and sets a number of standard global variables into the
calling package. Without arguments all the standard variables are set,
and with a list, only those variables whose names are provided are set.
The module will die if a variable which doesn\'t appear in its
C<%Config> hash is asked to be set.

The variables can also be references to arrays or hashes.

Edit C<%Config> to add or alter variables.

All the variables are in capitals, so that they resemble environment
variables.
