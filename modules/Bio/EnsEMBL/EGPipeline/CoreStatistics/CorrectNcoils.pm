=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::EGPipeline::CoreStatistics::CorrectNcoils

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ncoils program sometimes creates features that end one base beyond the
end of the translation. This seems to be a bug in the ncoils binary, rather
than anything we're doing wrong. Although a fix was attempted in the protein
features pipeline, it's actually much easier to fix here, once the translation
attributes have been calculated.
